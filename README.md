# Shi Programming Language (ã‚·)

_A productive and simple language for rapid exploration and iteration._

## What's Shi

Shi is an interpreted language that embraces the functional programming paradigm. It has many
features to help you quickly write websites, APIs and system management scripts. It's easy to work
with and helps you quickly get from start to finish.

## Features

- Simple syntax
- Functions are first class citizens
- Large standard library
- Package manager and good project tooling
- Garbage collected
- Macros
- Currying on all functions
- Immutable datastructures
- More functions, less datatypes: null, bool, string, int, float, list, vector, map, stream

## Status

Shi is currently in Alpha. It's working for some use cases but we are still working on defining
a good standard library, creating amazing tooling and documenting the language.

## Installing

Given that you have `go` install, an easy way to get `shi` installed is to run

```
go get github.com/shi-lang/shi
go install github.com/shi-lang/shi/cmd/shi
```

## Documentation

Visit [https://www.shi-lang.org/docs/](https://www.shi-lang.org/docs/).

## Building

Shi's interpreter is build using Golang, so, provided you have Go installed you should be able
to run:

```
make build
```

This will build the `shi` tool. To test it out simply run `./shi`.

The next step is to try and modify one of the `.go` files or some of the standard library `.shi`
files and run `make build` / `make test` again.
